## Stack

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (8.11.3)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (6.4.1)
* [Swagger Node](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-node) (2.0)
* [Standard JS](https://standardjs.com/) (12.0.1) to maintain a consistent code style

## Design Goals

- Use Cutting-Edge Technologies
- Best Programming Techniques
- Focus on application maintenability and code readability

---

## Getting Started

### Install NVM (Node Version Manager)
We use NVM to manage our Node verions to keep a consistent environment across developers.

[Follow install instructions here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script)

After the install, `cd` into the `hockey-pool-generator-frontend` directory and run `nvm use`. This will use the Node version defined in the `.nvm` file.

### Install yarn to a better package management

```sh
$ npm install --global yarn
```

Install application dependencies

```sh
$ yarn install
```

---

## Local Commands

In this current section you can find all commands to run the application in your machine. All the commands also are  in the `scripts` section of [package.json](package.json).

### Development (editing)

```sh
$ swagger project edit
```

---

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch with specs (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

---

## Rules
### Branch naming convention:
- For a feature : `features/{Trello-story-number}`
- For a bug : `bugs/{Trello-story-number}`
- For a hotfix : `hotfix/{Trello-story-number}`
- Example: features/HOC-01

### Commit messages should always start with: 
- `{Trello-story-number}`
- This gives us a quick reference point between our Git history and Trello
- Example: HOC-01: short description

### Feature branch history and merge : 
- Always keep your feature branch up to date with whatever base branch you've stemmed from.
- Merge the base branch into your feature branch at least once daily.
